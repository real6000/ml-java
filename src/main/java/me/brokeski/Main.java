/**
 * Made by real600
 *
 * This is the entry point of a custom machine learning framework written in Java.
 * The project is built from scratch (with inspiration), using only Java and no external libraries.
 * It includes its own matrix math engine, activation functions, neural network layers,
 * loss functions, and training logic â€” all designed to be expandable.
 * and don't get me wrong I got a lot of heavy inspiration from stack overflow and
 * existing works from others on machine learning.
 *
 * This file will eventually be used to load data, build a model, train it, and evaluate results.
