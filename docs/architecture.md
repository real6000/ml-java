# ðŸ§  Architecture Overview

This project is a modular neural network framework built from scratch in Java.

---

## Flow

1. **Data**  
   A dataset (like XOR) is wrapped in `DataPoint` objects (input + target).

2. **Network**  
   The network (either `NeuralNetwork` or `LayeredModel`) holds a list of layers.

3. **Layer**  
   Each layer has `forward()` and `backward()` methods.

4. **Trainer**  
   Runs the loop: forward â†’ loss â†’ backward â†’ update.
